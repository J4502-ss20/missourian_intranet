<h3 id="addinganarticle">Adding an Article</h3>
  <p>Click BLOX CMS Desktop to reveal the dropdown menu; select EDITORIAL > ASSETS.</p>
  <p>From the top left of the large central panel, select NEW ASSET, then ARTICLE from the dropdown menu.</p>
  <p>The new article window appears. In BLOX CMS, anything underlined in red is required information. Type the headline of the article in the Title field.</p>
  <p>Enter your article content either by directly typing into the text box or using the PASTE AS PLAIN TEXT button to copy and paste from a word processor.</p>
  <p>Use the START DATE/TIME field below the text entry area to determine your article publish time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>For immediate publish: save the article when it is done (allowing for caching time).</p></li>
    <li><p>For publishing at a future date: click the calendar icon. The article will publish automatically at the date and time set.</p></li>
    <li><p>Set the display priority.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>On the right side of the panel, there are three important tabs: Tags, Related, and Other.</p>
  <p>To add a section: click TAGS > SECTIONS > ADD.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>A section is required for a story to appear on the homepage and section pages.</p></li>
    <li><p>The SELECT SECTIONS screen will pop up; you then can choose the sections of the publication to which the article is to be assigned. You can select multiple sections at one time. When you are satisfied with the sections chosen, click ADD SECTIONS. Please drag and drop to put the most specific section at the top (i.e. K-12 EDUCATION instead of NEWS).</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Add five or more keywords in addition to the slugline (i.e. #05062020slug). Click TAGS > KEYWORDS > ADD.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>You can click the magic wand in the article text editor on the left side to get suggested keywords based on your text.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Under the RELATED tab, there are child assets, sibling assets and parent assets.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><h4>CHILD ASSETS</h4></li>
      <li><p>WHAT IT TYPICALLY IS: photos, links, PDFs, HTML assets, graphics and sidebar articles. Tese are the items directly related to an asset. Think about what is under a budget line — T, P, G, D. These are all part of the same package and should be children of the main asset.</p></li>
      <li><p>WHERE THEY SHOW UP on the parent (unless embedded in the story):</p></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>STANDARD PHOTOS: at the top of the story; multiple photos will go in a gallery</p></li>
        <li><p>MUGSHOTS (photos with presentation: mugshot): in the side rail</p></li>
        <li><p>HTML ASSETS: at the bottom of the story</p></li>
        <li><p>GRAPHICS: treated the same way as photos (highly recommended these are embedded in the article)</p></li>
        <li><p>LINKS: right rail</p></li>
        <li><p>PDFS: right rail</p></li>
        <li><p>SIDEBAR ARTICLES: right rail (summary is included in this link)</p></li>
      </ul>
      <li><p>IMPORTANT NOTE: assets that are children to another asset WILL NOT appear in blocks on the homepage or section pages. This prevents a PDF or individual photo from showing up alone on a homepage or section page. That said, related articles (not direct sidebards) should NOT be added as children to assets or they will disappear from blocks. Related articles should be sibling assets.</p></li>
    <li><h4>SIBLING ASSETS</h4></li>
      <li><p>WHAT IT TYPICALLY IS: assets tangentially related to other assets. We most commonly think of these as related articles (other columns by the same author, a story about the same event from last year, other stories tied to a location or topic, etc.). It can also include photos, collections, HTML assets, PDFs, etc.</p></li>
      <li><p>Also, sibling assets create a reciprocal relationship. When Article B is added as a sibling to Article A, Article A shows up as a sibling on Article B.</p></li>
      <li><p>WHERE THEY SHOW UP: on the right rail as standard links.</p></li>
    <li><h4>PARENT ASSETS</h4></li>
      <li><p>WHAT IT TYPICALLY IS: we most often think of it as an article, but the parent would be the main asset (in whatever form — photo, gallery, article, etc.) that has the directly related pieces.</p></li>
      <li><p>WHERE YOU SEE THE PARENT: There is a link to the parent asset that apepars at the bottom of the child asset. So if a reader gets to an individual photo, they would see a link to the related gallery and/or article.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><p>To add a new asset: choose the types of assets (child, sibling, parent) first. Then click ADD. FIND ASSETS will allow you to search for existing files.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>To add additional content: click RELATED > CONTENT > ADD and then select the type of content. You can change the title.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>TYPES OF ADDITIONAL CONTENT: Bio Box, Correction, Did You Know?, Editor's Note, If You Go, Just The Facts, More Coverage, More Information, Places To Go, Pull Quotes, Sports, Story Highlights, Update</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>To manage the article's workflow: Choose the OTHER tab.</p>
  <p>At the bottom of the screen, click SAVE. The VIEW button will become active. Click VIEW to see what your new asset will look like when published.</p>
  <p>When satisfied with the appearance of your new article asset, click the DOWN arrow next to SAVE, and select SAVE AND CLOSE. You can also promote it to the next step in the workflow at this point.</p>

<h3 id="loggingworkhours">Logging Work Hours</h3>
  <p>To log your hours: go to <a href="https://myhr.umsystem.edu/">https://myhr.umsystem.edu/</a> > SELF-SERVICE > TIME > REPORT TIME.</p>
  <p>PLEASE LOG YOUR SHIFTS AS YOU WORK THEM TO PREVENT MISSED PUNCHES.</p>
  <p>Pay remittances are only available online. To view your paycheck in myHR, click the PAYROLL tab.</p>
  <p>Some reminders for student employees:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Employees are responsible for accurately reporting hours, including clocking out for meal and rest breaks. When working a shift longer than six hours, the reasonable expectation is that employees will take at least a 30-minute unpaid meal break. Meals, classes/meetings and other breaks are non-compensable.</p></li>
    <li><p>UM System guidelines prevent student employees from working more than an average of 28 hours/week (roughly 121 hours/month) across ALL positions on campus. The Missourian limits your average weekly hours to about 20. If you consistently work more than 28 hours/week, you compromise your part-time, non-exempt status. That aside, we don't want you to put your academic pursuits in jeopardy.</p></li>
    <li><p>Weekends and special events may necessitate extended shifts. Those instances require a supervisor's approval. Most newsroom shifts do not exceed eight hours, and they should never exceed 12. Overtime is not authorized.</p></li>
    <li><p>If your shift has waiting time or other lulls, speak to your supervisor about how or if you should schedule around it. Some wait time is compensable, but it isn't always in the best interest of your time management or ours to keep you on the clock during non-busy periods, especially when you're signed on for a long shift.</p></li>
  </ul>
