  <h2>Editor Resources</h2>

  <h3 id="article">ADDING AN ARTICLE</h3>
    <p>Click  CMS Desktop to reveal the dropdown menu; select Editorial > Assets.</p>
    <p>From the top left of the large central panel, select New Asset, then Article from the dropdown menu.</p>
    <p>The new article window appears. In Blox CMS, anything underlined in red is required information. Type the headline of the article in the Title field.</p>
    <p>Enter your article content either by directly typing into the text box or using the Paste as Plain Text button to copy and paste from a word processor.</p>
    <p>Use the Start Date/Time field below the text entry area to determine your article publish time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>For immediate publish: save the article when it is done (allowing for caching time).</p></li>
      <li><p>For publishing at a future date: click the calendar icon. The article will publish automatically at the date and time set.</p></li>
      <li><p>Set the display priority.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the right side of the panel, there are three important tabs: Tags, Related, and Other.</p>
    <p>To add a section: click Tags > Sections > Add.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>A section is required for a story to appear on the homepage and section pages.</p></li>
      <li><p>The Select Sections screen will pop up; you then can choose the sections of the publication to which the article is to be assigned. You can select multiple sections at one time. When you are satisfied with the sections chosen, click Add Sections. Please drag and drop to put the most specific section at the top (i.e. K-12 Education instead of News).</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add five or more keywords in addition to the slugline (i.e. #05062020slug). Click Tags > Keywords > Add.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>You can click the magic wand in the article text editor on the left side to get suggested keywords based on your text.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under the Related tab, there are <a href="#related">child assets, sibling assets and parent assets</a>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>To add a new asset: choose the types of assets (child, sibling, parent) first. Then click Add. Find Assets will allow you to search for existing files.</p></li>
      <li><p>In the settings of the block, click on Appearance. Click on the arrow to see the options for additional content.</p></li>
      <li><p>Choose the type of content and number of assets. Set the display mode as a regular vertical list.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To add additional content: click Related > Content > Add and then select the type of content. You can change the title.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">Types of additional content:</span> Bio Box, Correction, Did You Know?, Editor's Note, If You Go, Just The Facts, More Coverage, More Information, Places To Go, Pull Quotes, Sports, Story Highlights, Update</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To manage the article's workflow: Choose the Other tab.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of the screen, click Save. The View button will become active. Click View to see what your new asset will look like when published.</p>
    <p>When satisfied with the appearance of your new article asset, click the down arrow next to Save, and select Save and Close. You can also promote it to the next step in the workflow at this point.</p>

  <h3 id="subheads">ADDING SUBHEADS IN BLOX</h3>
    <p>We use subheads a lot (which is great!), and there are options in Blox to make them stand out more and also automatically make them a subhead in print.</p>
    <p>We don't want to just bold the subheads. They get lost in the story, and it won't translate over in print.</p>
    <p>Going to Heading 4 gives you a slightly larger subhead and automates it for print. To go larger, which may be appropriate for some stories, you could use Heading 3. You can always combine Heading 3 and Heading 4 to have multiple levels of subheads with hierarchy.</p>
    <p>To get Heading 3 or Heading 4 into a story: Highlight the line you want to be a subhead, and select the heading from the dropdown that says Format: Normal Text in the text editor.</p>

  <h3 id="related">RELATED ASSETS</p>
    <h4>Child Assets</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">What it typically is:</span> photos, links, PDFs, HTML assets, graphics and sidebar articles. These are the items directly related to an asset. Think about what is under a budget line â€” T, P, G, D. These are all part of the same package and should be children of the main asset.</p></li>
      <li><p><span id="bold">Where they show up on the parent (unless embedded in the story):</span></p></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p><span id="bold">Standard photos:</span> at the top of the story; multiple photos will go in a gallery</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">Mugshots (photos with presentation: mugshot):</span> in the side rail</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">HTML assets:</span> at the bottom of the story</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">Graphics:</span> treated the same way as photos (highly recommended these are embedded in the article)</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">Links:</span> right rail</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">PDFs:</span> right rail</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">Sidebar articles:</span> right rail (summary is included in this link)</p></li>
      </ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">Important note:</span> assets that are children to another asset will not appear in blocks on the homepage or section pages. This prevents a PDF or individual photo from showing up alone on a homepage or section page. That said, related articles (not direct sidebards) should not be added as children to assets or they will disappear from blocks. Related articles should be sibling assets.</p></li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Sibling Assets</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">What it typically is:</span> assets tangentially related to other assets. We most commonly think of these as related articles (other columns by the same author, a story about the same event from last year, other stories tied to a location or topic, etc.). It can also include photos, collections, HTML assets, PDFs, etc.</p></li>
      <li><p>Also, sibling assets create a reciprocal relationship. When Article B is added as a sibling to Article A, Article A shows up as a sibling on Article B.</p></li>
      <li><p><span id="bold">Where they show up:</span> on the right rail as standard links.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Parent Assets</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">What it typically is:</span> we most often think of it as an article, but the parent would be the main asset (in whatever form â€” photo, gallery, article, etc.) that has the directly related pieces.</p></li>
      <li><p><span id="bold">Where they show up:</span> there is a link to the parent asset that apepars at the bottom of the child asset. So if a reader gets to an individual photo, they would see a link to the related gallery and/or article.</p></li>
    </ul>

  <h3 id="obits">OBITUARIES AND DEATH NOTICES</h3>
    <h4>Death Notices</h4>

    <h4>Obituary FAQs</h4>
    <p><span id="bold">Do we publish family obits as received?</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Yes. Please post family obits the way they are written, but be sure to read them over to make sure there are no typos or obvious mistakes. Post under the section Obituaries: Family Obits and use #fulldatelastnamefamilyobit as the keyword.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span id="bold">When do we embark on a life story?</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>People who have spent at least one year of their adult life (post-college) in Columbia and if the funeral service is at least three days in the future.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span id="bold">How many days do we roll a life story?</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Typically just two, but sometimes if the person is extremely important to the community, we may make an exception.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span id="bold">Should we put obits on the budget?</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Please. If there is no life story, make sure the copy desk can read that (in blue) on the budget so the desk will know to run the family obit ASAP without waiting to determine where a life story will come through.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span id="bold">When do we give up on a life story?</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Generally after 48 hours of no luck and no expectation of having any.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span id="bold">What do we include in the night note?</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>It canâ€™t hurt to let everyone know that a life story is either still in play or has been spiked. Also, if a GA reporter is not continuing a life story that is still in play, please tell the next ACE to assign someone and get a hand-off (i.e. get the name/number of a reporter who may have made some contacts so the new reporter can check in with the old reporter). Early a.m. ACEs, please check the overnight email to see if an obit came in after hours.</p></li>
    </ul>

  <h3 id="reporter-checklist">REPORTER CHECKLIST</h3>
    <p>Before promoting a story, check to make sure you have done these things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Does the article have assigned sections?</p></li>
      <li><p>Have you added relevant keywords?</p></li>
      <li><p>Have you added the slug keyword (#MMDDYYYYslug)? Does it match the budget (check with your editor)?</p></li>
      <li><p>Have you set a display priority (5 is the standard)?</p></li>
      <li><p>Have you added related articles as sibling assets?</p></li>
      <li><p>Have you written a summary?</p></li>
      <li><p>Does your article have you as the author and byline?</p></li>
      <li><p>Have you previewed the article?</p></li>
    </ul>
