  <h3 id="article">ADDING AN ARTICLE</h3>
    <p>Click  CMS Desktop to reveal the dropdown menu; select Editorial > Assets.</p>
    <p>From the top left of the large central panel, select New Asset, then Article from the dropdown menu.</p>
    <p>The new article window appears. In Blox CMS, anything underlined in red is required information. Type the headline of the article in the Title field.</p>
    <p>Enter your article content either by directly typing into the text box or using the Paste as Plain Text button to copy and paste from a word processor.</p>
    <p>Use the Start Date/Time field below the text entry area to determine your article publish time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>For immediate publish: save the article when it is done (allowing for caching time).</p></li>
      <li><p>For publishing at a future date: click the calendar icon. The article will publish automatically at the date and time set.</p></li>
      <li><p>Set the display priority.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the right side of the panel, there are three important tabs: Tags, Related, and Other.</p>
    <p>To add a section: click Tags > Sections > Add.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>A section is required for a story to appear on the homepage and section pages.</p></li>
      <li><p>The Select Sections screen will pop up; you then can choose the sections of the publication to which the article is to be assigned. You can select multiple sections at one time. When you are satisfied with the sections chosen, click Add Sections. Please drag and drop to put the most specific section at the top (i.e. K-12 Education instead of News).</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add five or more keywords in addition to the slugline (i.e. #05062020slug). Click Tags > Keywords > Add.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>You can click the magic wand in the article text editor on the left side to get suggested keywords based on your text.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Under the Related tab, there are child assets, sibling assets and parent assets.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>To add a new asset: choose the types of assets (child, sibling, parent) first. Then click Add. Find Assets will allow you to search for existing files.</p></li>
      <li><p>In the settings of the block, click on Appearance. Click on the arrow to see the options for additional content.</p></li>
      <li><p>Choose the type of content and number of assets. Set the display mode as a regular vertical list.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To add additional content: click Related > Content > Add and then select the type of content. You can change the title.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">Types of additional content:</span> Bio Box, Correction, Did You Know?, Editor's Note, If You Go, Just The Facts, More Coverage, More Information, Places To Go, Pull Quotes, Sports, Story Highlights, Update</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To manage the article's workflow: Choose the Other tab.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of the screen, click Save. The View button will become active. Click View to see what your new asset will look like when published.</p>
    <p>When satisfied with the appearance of your new article asset, click the down arrow next to Save, and select Save and Close. You can also promote it to the next step in the workflow at this point.</p>

  <h3 id="phone">MISSOURIAN PHONE</h3>
    <p>Answer the phone: "Columbia Missourian, this is [your name], may I help you?"</p>
    <p>Email phone messages to reporters right away, or call the reporter yourself. DO NOT give reporters' phone numbers to sources. DOUBLE-CHECK PHONE NUMBERS AND NAMES / SPELLINGS.</p>
    <p>Check voicemail is MSG Wait is lit.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Press the phone line, then press <span class="bold">MSG Wait</span>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The passcode is 573-882-5720.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can answer incoming calls on any newsroom phone by picking up the receiver and dialing 82.</p>
    <p>To transfer a call:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>If the call is on hold, press the phone line again to take it off hold.</p></li>
      <li><p>Press Transfer, the 5-digit extension, then Transfer again.</p></li>
      <li><p>Hang up the phone.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Give the caller the number to which you are transfering them in case of a problem.</p>

  <h3 id="shift1b"> HOW TO: 1B DESIGN SHIFT</h4>
    <p><span id="bold">7:00:</span> Arrive for your shift. Open the Print Budget Google Doc and see what’s slated. Meet with the sports TA to determine what the centerpiece is and ask any questions you may have.</p>

  <h3 id="pdf">HOW TO: PDF PAGES</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The paginator will always need to create and PDF the Timeout pages. For Sunday papers Timeout will always be 8B, under Daily Sports Query. Every other day it will be 7A, under Daily News.</p></li>
      <li><p>Open the page you would like to PDF in InDesign.</p></li>
      <li><p>Command E.</p></li>
      <li><p>Change “Format” field to “Adobe PDF (Print).”</p></li>
      <li><p>Navigate to mofiles > Publications > Missourian > Missourian pages > June 2014 > 14.06.29 > B section (with current date and correct section).</p></li>
      <li><p>In the “Save As” field, type MOMMDDDP_section_pagenumber_C with corresponding info (i.e. MO0629DP_B_8_C.pdf).</p></li>
      <li><p>Click “Save.”</p></li>
      <li><p>In dialog box that comes up, change the Adobe .pdf preset from [High Quality Print] to [Press Quality].</p></li>
      <li><p>Check “View .pdf after Exporting.”</p></li>
      <li><p>Press “Export.”</p></li>
    </ul>

  <h3 id="printonly">PRINT ONLY WORKFLOW</h3>
    <p>The print workflow is now tied to the website, but we obviously don’t want everything in print to go online.</p>
    <p>When you have an item on a page that is not for web — think 1A teases, merged briefs, etc. — you will use the Print Only workflow.</p>
    <p>It is likely that these print only items started on the page itself. You’ll want to create a new article for those items, assign a slug and add them to the Print Only workflow. This will still send them through the copy desk, but it won’t put them online.</p>
    <p>If you have an article where you are struggling with reflows or other issues and you need to release it, you can do the same thing. Create the new article and assign it to the Print Only workflow so we don’t have duplicate stories online.</p>

  <h3 id="briefs">BRIEFS AND MERGED ASSETS</h3>
    <p>There’s a useful trick to putting together a briefs package.</p>
    <p>First, draw your textbox that will contain all of your briefs. With the box selected, go to the asset manager. Find your first brief. Check the box that says merge and then click merge.</p>
    <p>If there are photos with the story, make sure you don’t include them.</p>
    <p>Repeat with the next brief until you have them all.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Another trick: If all of your briefs had the same keyword (#briefs) or were assigned to the page and available on the budget view, you can select them all (Cmd+click lets you select more than one even if they aren’t next to each other), and then a window will pop to allow you to change the order.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The briefs will come in with the correct paragraph styles and web headlines. Note that brief headlines are only two lines.</p>
    <p>You add the byline at the end of the briefs with an em dash —. For example: — Elizabeth Stephens/Missourian or — The Associated Press. The paragraph style is Bdy-Tagline2.</p>
    <p>The label for briefs is a snippet (Blox TCMS>Place Design Element Snippets>News Elements>Briefs label).</p>
    <p>Once you have all your briefs setup, you’ll need to go through the steps to create a new article. Merging the assets releases them. For the workflow, you want to select "Print Only" to prevent them from publishing online.</p>

  <h3 id="corrections">CORRECTIONS</h3>
    <p>Print corrections should follow this basic construction: "Casey Smith is an art teacher at Paxton Keeley Elementary School. An article on Page 1A Thursday incorrectly identified Smith's occupation."</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Corrections never say "should have said."</p></li>
      <li><p>Corrections run on Page 1A or, if room is needed for more, on page 2A. If there are additional corrections for Page 2A, put at the bottom of the corrections box on Page 1A: "Please see additional corrections on Page 2A."</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Online corrections should follow these basic constructions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">For articles:</span> on the article, go to the Related tab and click on Content. Add new and select Correction. Type the correction in the box.</p></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>An asterisk should be placed at the start of every correction:</p></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>*The MU mascot is a Bengal tiger. An earlier version of this article misidentified the mascot.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <li><p>An asterisk also should be noted in the story immediately following the corrected copy:</p></li>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The MU mascot is a Bengal* tiger.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">For photos:</span> corrected captions should be noted in the caption field:</p></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>CORRECTED CAPTION: Casey Smith loads a bag of canned goods into a truck Tuesday as part of Columbia's annual food drive. A total of 73 bags of canned goods were collected on Tuesday alone. An earlier version of this caption misstated the number of bags loaded by the city on Tuesday.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">For graphics:</span> corrections should be noted underneath the corrected graphic in the caption field:</p></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>CORRECTION: Jimmy John's is located on Broadway. An earlier version of this graphic incorrectly stated its location.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <li><p><span id="bold">For slideshows:</span> corrections should be noted in the description tab field and appear above the introductory paragraph for the corrected slideshow:</p></li>
      <ul>
        <li><p>CORRECTION: In the fourth photo of this slideshow, Casey Smith, depicted licking an ice cream cone, is 5 years old. An earlier version of this slideshow incorrectly stated his age.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>When a correction is made, add #correction in the Keywords tab of the asset.</p>
